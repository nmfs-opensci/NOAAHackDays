Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git JupyterLab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

    "text": "Summary\n\nIn this example we will use the earthaccess package to search for OCI products on NASA Earthdata. The earthaccess package, published on the Python Package Index and conda-forge, facilitates discovery and use of all NASA Earth Science data products by providing an abstraction layer for NASA’s Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API and by simplifying requests to NASA’s Earthdata Cloud. Searching for data is more approachable using earthaccess than low-level HTTP requests, and the same goes for S3 requests.\nIn short, earthaccess helps authenticate with Earthdata Login, makes search easier, and provides a stream-lined way to load data into xarray containers. For more on earthaccess, visit the documentation site. Be aware that earthaccess is under active development.\nTo understand the discussions below on downloading and opening data, we need to clearly understand where our notebook is running. There are three cases to distinguish:\n\nThe notebook is running on the local host. For instance, you started a Jupyter server on your laptop.\nThe notebook is running on a remote host, but it does not have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. For instance, you are running in GitHub Codespaces.\nThe notebook is running on a remote host that does have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. At this time, we cannot provide a “for instance” which is available to everyone."

Setup ***\nWe begin by importing the only package used in this notebook. If you have created an environment following the guidance provided with this tutorial, then the import will be successful.\n\nimport earthaccess\n\nBack to top  ## 2. NASA Earthdata Authentication ***\nNext, we authenticate using our Earthdata Login credentials. Authentication is not needed to search publicaly available collections in Earthdata, but is always needed to access data. We can use the login method from the earthaccess package. This will create an authenticated session when we provide a valid Earthdata Login username and password. The earthaccess package will search for credentials defined by environmental variables or within a .netrc file saved in the home directory. If credentials are not found, an interactive prompt will allow you to input credentials.\n\nThe persist=True argument ensures any discovered credentials are stored in a .netrc file, so the argument is not necessary (but it’s also harmless) for subsequent calls to earthaccess.login.\n\n\nauth = earthaccess.login(persist=True)\n\nBack to top  ## 3. Search for Data ***\nCollections on NASA Earthdata are discovered with the search_datasets function, which accepts an instrument filter as an easy way to get started. Each of the items in the list of collections returned has a “short-name”.\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_datasets(instrument=\"oci\")\n\n\nfor item in results:\n    summary = item.summary()\n    print(summary[\"short-name\"])\n\nNext, we use the search_data function to find granules within a collection. Let’s use the short_name for the PACE/OCI Level-2 quick-look product for apparent optical properties (although you can search for granules accross collections too).\n\nThe short name can also be found on  Eartdata Search, directly under the collection name, after clicking on the “i” button for a collection in any search result.\n\nThe count argument limits the number of granules returned and stored in the results list.\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L2_AOP_NRT\",\n    count=1,\n)\n\nWe can refine our search by passing more parameters that describe the spatiotemporal domain of our use case. Here, we use the temporal parameter to request a date range and the bounding_box parameter to request granules that intersect with a bounding box. We can even provide a cloud_cover threshold to limit files that have a lower percetnage of cloud cover. We do not provide a count, so we’ll get all granules that satisfy the constraints.\n\ntspan = (\"2024-04-01\", \"2024-04-16\")\nbbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)\nclouds = (0, 50)\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L2_AOP_NRT\",\n    temporal=tspan,\n    bounding_box=bbox, \n    cloud_cover=clouds,\n)\n\nDisplaying a single result shows a direct download link: try it! The link will download the granule to your local machine, which may or may not be what you want to do. Even if you are running the notebook on a remote host, this download link will open a new browser tab or window and offer to save a file to your local machine. If you are running the notebook locally, this may be of use. However, in the next section we’ll see how to download all the results with one command.\n\nresults[0]\n\nBack to top  ## 4. Download Data ***\nFirst, let’s understand what the alternative is to downloading granules. The earthaccess.open function accepts the list of results from earthaccess.search_data and returns a list of file-like objects, but no actual files are transferred.\n\npaths = earthaccess.open(results)\n\nThe file-like objects held in paths can each be read like a normal file. Here we load the first few bytes without any specialized reader.\n\nwith paths[0] as file:\n    line = file.readline().strip()\nline\n\nOf course that doesn’t mean anything (does it? 😉), because this is a binary file that needs a reader which understands the file format.\nThe earthaccess.open function is used when you want to directly read a bytes from a remote filesystem, but not download a whole file. When running code on a host with direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud, you don’t need to download the data and earthaccess.open is the way to go.\nNow, let’s look at the earthaccess.download function, which is used to copy files onto a filesystem local to the machine executing the code. For this function, provide the output of earthaccess.search_data along with a directory where earthaccess will store downloaded granules.\nEven if you only want to read a slice of the data, and downloading seems unncessary, if you use earthaccess.open while not running on a remote host with direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud, performance will be very poor. This is not a problem with “the cloud” or with earthaccess, it has to do with the data format and may soon be resolved.\nLet’s continue to downloading the list of granules!\n\npaths = earthaccess.download(results, \"L2_AOP\")\n\nThe paths list now contains paths to actual files on the local filesystem.\n\npaths\n\n\nAnywhere in any of these notebooks where\npaths = earthaccess.open(...)\nis used to read data directly from the NASA Earthdata Cloud, you need to substitute\npaths = earthaccess.download(..., local_path)\nbefore running the notebook on a local host or a remote host that does not have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud.\n\n\n\nYou have completed the notebook on downloading and opening datasets. We now suggest starting the notebook on File Structure at Three Processing Levels."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGoals\n\nIllustrate a common workflow for echosounder data conversion, calibration and use. This workflow leverages the standardization applied by echopype and the power, ease of use and familiarity of libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem.\nExtract and visualize data with relative ease using geospatial and temporal filters.\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis notebook uses EK60 echosounder data collected during the 2017 Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic Trawl Survey (‘Pacific Hake Survey’) to illustrate a common workflow for data conversion, calibration and analysis using echopype and core scientific Python software packages, particularly xarray, GeoPandas, pandas and NumPy.\nTwo days of cloud-hosted .raw data files are accessed by echopype directly from an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 “bucket” maintained by the NOAA NCEI Water-Column Sonar Data Archive. The total data used are 170 .raw files at approximately 25 MB each (1 Hz pinging rate from first light to dusk), corresponding to approximately 4.2 GB. With echopype, each file is converted to a standardized representation based on the SONAR-netCDF4 v1.0 convention and saved to the cloud-optimized Zarr format.\nData stored in the netCDF-based SONAR-netCDF4 convention can be conveniently and intuitively manipulated with xarray in combination with related scientific Python packages. Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (MVBS) is computed with echopype from each raw data file and exported to a netCDF file. Here, we define two geographical bounding boxes encompassing two ship tracks and use these to extract corresponding timestamp intervals from the GPS data, and then the corresponding MVBS data based on those intervals. Finally, these extracted MVBS subsets are plotted as track echograms.\n\n\nOutline\n\nEstablish AWS S3 file system connection and generate list of target EK60 .raw files\nProcess S3-hosted raw files with echopype: convert, calibrate and export to standardized files\nExtract and process GPS locations from the Platform group of converted raw files\nRead MVBS and plot track echograms for time periods corresponding to two ship tracks\n\n\n\nRunning the notebook\nThis notebook can be run with a conda environment created using the conda environment file https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples/blob/main/binder/environment.yml. The notebook creates two directories, if not already present: ./exports/hakesurvey_convertedzarr and ./exports/hakesurvey_calibratednc. netCDF and Zarr files will be exported there.\n\n\nNote\nWe encourage importing echopype as ep for consistency.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport fsspec\nimport numpy as np\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport xarray as xr\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport cartopy.io.img_tiles as cimgt\nfrom cartopy.mpl.gridliner import LONGITUDE_FORMATTER, LATITUDE_FORMATTER\n\nimport echopype as ep\nfrom echopype.qc import exist_reversed_time\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\n\n\nfrom dask.distributed import Client\n\n\nclient = Client()\n\n\nclient\n\n\n     \n    \n        Client\n        Client-0457e919-0407-11ef-80d7-820f588673e5\n        \n\n\n\nConnection method: Cluster object\nCluster type: distributed.LocalCluster\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/8787/status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                Launch dashboard in JupyterLab\n            \n        \n\n        \n            \n            Cluster Info\n            \n    \n    \n    \n        LocalCluster\n        5abba2b3\n        \n\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/8787/status\nWorkers: 4\n\n\nTotal threads: 8\nTotal memory: 31.34 GiB\n\n\nStatus: running\nUsing processes: True\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                Scheduler Info\n            \n\n            \n    \n         \n        \n            Scheduler\n            Scheduler-b7dda29b-c5bc-4ea7-ab66-7890b5e5cc79\n            \n\n\n\nComm: tcp://127.0.0.1:38903\nWorkers: 4\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/8787/status\nTotal threads: 8\n\n\nStarted: Just now\nTotal memory: 31.34 GiB\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n            Workers\n        \n\n        \n        \n             \n            \n            \n                \n                    Worker: 0\n                \n                \n\n\n\nComm: tcp://127.0.0.1:43205\nTotal threads: 2\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/43023/status\nMemory: 7.84 GiB\n\n\nNanny: tcp://127.0.0.1:40977\n\n\n\nLocal directory: /tmp/dask-scratch-space/worker-8hk9umex\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n        \n        \n        \n             \n            \n            \n                \n                    Worker: 1\n                \n                \n\n\n\nComm: tcp://127.0.0.1:33021\nTotal threads: 2\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/33901/status\nMemory: 7.84 GiB\n\n\nNanny: tcp://127.0.0.1:43227\n\n\n\nLocal directory: /tmp/dask-scratch-space/worker-rtm3hewa\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n        \n        \n        \n             \n            \n            \n                \n                    Worker: 2\n                \n                \n\n\n\nComm: tcp://127.0.0.1:36503\nTotal threads: 2\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/34185/status\nMemory: 7.84 GiB\n\n\nNanny: tcp://127.0.0.1:42299\n\n\n\nLocal directory: /tmp/dask-scratch-space/worker-sq1_hzly\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n        \n        \n        \n             \n            \n            \n                \n                    Worker: 3\n                \n                \n\n\n\nComm: tcp://127.0.0.1:32945\nTotal threads: 2\n\n\nDashboard: /user/leewujung/proxy/38863/status\nMemory: 7.84 GiB\n\n\nNanny: tcp://127.0.0.1:38595\n\n\n\nLocal directory: /tmp/dask-scratch-space/worker-ewwsz9bc"

It is essentially a container for multiple xarray.Dataset objects, each corresponds to one of the netCDF4 groups specified in the SONAR-netCDF4 convention – the convention followed by echopype. The EchoData object can be used to conveniently accesse and explore the echosounder raw data and for calibration and other processing.\nThe cell below contains the main echopype workflow steps. For each raw file: - Access file directly from S3 via ep.open_raw to create a converted EchoData object in memory - Add global and platform attributes to EchoData object - Export to a local Zarr dataset (a collection of files encapsulated in a directory) - Generate calibrated Sv and then MVBS from the raw data in the EchoData object - Export MVBS to a local netcdf file\nNote: Depending on your internet speed, this cell may take some time to run (potentially 20-30 mins).\n\n# %%time\n\n# for s3rawfpath in s3rawfiles:\n#     raw_fpath = Path(s3rawfpath)\n#     try:\n#         # Access file directly from S3 to create a converted EchoData object in memory\n#         ed = ep.open_raw(\n#             f\"s3://{s3rawfpath}\",\n#             sonar_model='EK60',\n#             storage_options={'anon': True}\n#         )\n#         # Manually populate additional metadata about the dataset and the platform\n#         populate_metadata(ed, raw_fpath.name)\n\n#         # Save to converted Zarr format\n#         ed.to_zarr(save_path=converted_dpath, overwrite=True)\n\n#         # Use the EchoData object \"ed\" to generate calibrated and\n#         # computed MVBS files that will be saved to netcdf\n#         ds_Sv = ep.calibrate.compute_Sv(ed)\n#         ds_MVBS = ep.commongrid.compute_MVBS(\n#             ds_Sv,\n#             range_meter_bin=5,  # in meters\n#             ping_time_bin='20s'  # in seconds\n#         )\n#         ds_MVBS.to_netcdf(calibrated_dpath / f\"MVBS_{raw_fpath.stem}.nc\")\n#     except Exception as e:\n#         print(f\"Failed to process raw file {raw_fpath.name}: {e}\")\n\n\n\nTest for time reversals\nSmall time reversals are found in EK60 datasets, including the 2017 Pacific Hake survey, where the ping_time (or GPS time1) value may be lower (older) than the preceding ping_time by a second. Such discontinuities can interfere with concatenating individual raw files to produce an aggregated dataset. The capability to identify and address these reversals is in the echopype.qc subpackage.\n\n%%time\nfor datapath in converted_dpath.glob('*'):\n    ed = ep.open_converted(datapath, chunks={})\n    # Test for a negative ping_time increment in sequential timestamps, in the Sonar/Beam_group1 group\n    if exist_reversed_time(ds=ed['Sonar/Beam_group1'], time_name=\"ping_time\"):\n        print(f\"Reversed time in {datapath}\")\n\nCPU times: user 19.7 s, sys: 6.21 s, total: 25.9 s\nWall time: 2min 9s\n\n\nThere are no time reversals in this two-day dataset, fortunately.\n\n\nExamine the EchoData object for one of the data files\nechopype provides a user-friendly, convenient representation of an EchoData object that leverages the user-friendly xarray Dataset HTML representation. Since an EchoData object is effectively a container for multiple xarray.Dataset objects corresponding to netCDF4 groups, the notebook “print out” provides a summary view of all the groups and interactive access to summaries of each group.\nHere, ed is the last object opened in the time reversal test, in the preceding cell.\n\ned = ep.open_converted(list(converted_dpath.glob('*'))[0],

Extract from those clipped GeoDataFrames (tracksouth_gps_gdf and tracknorth_gps_gdf) the minimum and maximum time1 timestamps for each track and use them to select the corresponding time span in the MVBS data.\nFinally, create a MVBS Dataset subset for each track (tracksouth_MVBS_ds and tracknorth_MVBS_ds) by taking advantage of xarray’s “label”-based selection capability via the sel method. We select MVBS_ds data with ping_time values within the timestamp interval “slice” extracted from the geographical track. As we can see above, ping_time is a coordinate variable in the MVBS_ds Dataset.\n\ntracksouth_gps_gdf = gpd.clip(gps_gdf, tracksouth_bbox)\ntracksouth_MVBS_ds = MVBS_ds.sel(\n    ping_time=slice(tracksouth_gps_gdf.index.min(), tracksouth_gps_gdf.index.max())\n)\n\ntracknorth_gps_gdf = gpd.clip(gps_gdf, tracknorth_bbox)\ntracknorth_MVBS_ds = MVBS_ds.sel(\n    ping_time=slice(tracknorth_gps_gdf.index.min(), tracknorth_gps_gdf.index.max())\n)\n\n\n\nPlot MVBS echograms for the two N-S tracks, for all 3 frequencies\nThe final step is to create echogram plots (range vs ping_time) for each echosounder frequency and each of the two selected ship tracks. That’s 6 subplots. We first define two functions to simplify the task. plot_echograms plots the echograms of the 3 frequencies as a column of subplots, extracting the data for each frequency by using xarray’s isel index selector method, which uses index counts rather than values.

This workflow leverages the standardization applied by echopype and the power, ease of use and familiarity of libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem.\nExtract and visualize data with relative ease.\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis notebook uses EK60 echosounder data collected during the 2017 Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic Trawl Survey (‘Pacific Hake Survey’) to illustrate a common workflow for data conversion, calibration and analysis using echopype and core scientific Python software packages, particularly xarray, GeoPandas and pandas.\nTwo days of cloud-hosted .raw data files are accessed by echopype directly from an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 “bucket” maintained by the NOAA NCEI Water-Column Sonar Data Archive. With echopype, each file is converted to a standardized representation based on the SONAR-netCDF4 v1.0 convention and saved to the Zarr cloud-optimized file format.\nData stored in the Zarr (or netCDF) file format using the SONAR-netCDF4 convention can be conveniently and intuitively manipulated with xarray in combination with related scientific Python packages. Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (MVBS) is computed with echopype from the combined, converted raw data files, after calibration. The GPS location track and MVBS echograms are visualized.\n\n\nRunning the notebook\nThis notebook can be run with a conda environment created using the conda environment file https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples/blob/main/binder/environment.yml. The notebook creates the ./exports directory, if not already present. Zarr files will be exported there.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport fsspec\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport xarray as xr\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport cartopy.io.img_tiles as cimgt\nfrom cartopy.mpl.gridliner import LONGITUDE_FORMATTER, LATITUDE_FORMATTER\nimport hvplot.xarray\n\nimport echopype as ep\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)"

The library makes searching for data more approachable by using a simpler notation instead of low level HTTP queries. earthaccess takes the trouble out of Earthdata Login authentication, makes search easier, and provides a stream-line way to download or stream search results into an xarray object.\nFor more on earthaccess visit the earthaccess GitHub page and/or the earthaccess documentation site.

The table below contains the short_name, concept_id, and doi for some collections we are interested in for other exercises. Each of these can be used to search for data or information related to the collection we are interested in.\n\n\n\nShortname\nCollection Concept ID\nDOI\n\n\n\n\nGPM_3IMERGDF\nC2723754864-GES_DISC\n10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/07\n\n\nMOD10C1\nC1646609808-NSIDC_ECS\n10.5067/MODIS/MOD10C1.061\n\n\nSPL4SMGP\nC2531308461-NSIDC_ECS\n10.5067/EVKPQZ4AFC4D\n\n\nSPL4SMAU\nC2537927247-NSIDC_ECS\n10.5067/LWJ6TF5SZRG3\n\n\n\nBut wait…You may be asking “how can we find the shortname, concept_id, and doi for collections not in the table above?”. Let’s take a quick detour.\nhttps://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=GPM_3IMERGDF\n\nSearch by collection\n\n#collection_id = 'C2723754864-GES_DISC'\ncollection_id = 'C1598621096-GES_DISC'\n\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    concept_id = collection_id,\n    cloud_hosted = True,\n    count = 10    # Restricting to 10 records returned\n)\n\nGranules found: 7792\n\n\nIn this example we used the concept_id parameter to search from our desired collection. However, there are multiple ways to specify the collection(s) we are interested in. Alternative parameters include:\n\ndoi - request collection by digital object identifier (e.g., doi = ‘10.5067/GPM/IMERGDF/DAY/07’)\n\nshort_name - request collection by CMR shortname (e.g., short_name = ‘GPM_3IMERGDF’)\n\nNOTE: Each Earthdata collect has a unique concept_id and doi. This is not the case with short_name. A shortname can be associated with multiple versions of a collection. If multiple versions of a collection are publicaly available, using the short_name parameter with return all versions available. It is advised to use the version parameter in conjunction with the short_name parameter with searching.\nWe can refine our search by passing more parameters that describe the spatiotemporal domain of our use case. Here, we use the temporal parameter to request a date range and the bounding_box parameter to request granules that intersect with a bounding box.\nFor our bounding box, we are going to read in a GeoJSON file containing a single feature and extract the coordinate pairs for the southeast corner and the northwest corner (or lowerleft and upperright corners) of the bounding box around the feature.\n\ninGeojson = gpd.read_file('../../NOAAHackDay-Dec-2023/data/sf_to_sierranvmt.geojson')\n\n\nxmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = inGeojson.total_bounds\n\nWe will assign our start date and end date to a variable named date_range and we’ll assign the southeast and the northwest corner coordinates to a variable named bbox to be passed to our earthaccess search request.\n\n#date_range = (\"2022-11-19\", \"2023-04-06\")\ndate_range = (\"2019-11-19\", \"2019-12-06\")\nbbox = (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)\n\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    concept_id = collection_id,\n    cloud_hosted = True,\n    temporal = date_range,\n    bounding_box = bbox,\n)\n\nGranules found: 18\n\n\n\nThe short_name and concept_id search parameters can be used to request one or multiple collections per request, but the doi parameter can only request a single collection.\n&gt; concept_ids = [‘C2723754864-GES_DISC’, ‘C1646609808-NSIDC_ECS’]\n\nUse the cloud_hosted search parameter only to search for data assets available from NASA’s Earthdata Cloud.\nThere are even more search parameters that can be passed to help refine our search, however those parameters do have to be populated in the CMR record to be leveraged. A non exhaustive list of examples are below:\n\nday_night_flag = 'day'\n\ncloud_cover = (0, 10)\n\n\n\n# col_ids = ['C2723754864-GES_DISC', 'C1646609808-NSIDC_ECS', 'C2531308461-NSIDC_ECS', 'C2537927247-NSIDC_ECS']    # Specify a list of collections to pass to the search\n\n# results = earthaccess.search_data(\n#     concept_id = col_ids,\n#     #cloud_hosted = True,\n#     temporal = date_range,\n#     bounding_box = bbox,\n# )\n\n\n\n\nWorking with earthaccess returns\nearthaccess provides several convenience methods to help streamline processes that historically have be painful when done using traditional methods. Following the search for data, you’ll likely take one of two pathways with those results. You may choose to download the assets that have been returned to you or you may choose to continue working with the search results within the Python environment.\n\nDownload earthaccess results\nIn some cases you may want to download your assets. earthaccess makes downloading the data from the search results very easy using the earthaccess.download() function.\n\ndownloaded_files = earthaccess.download(\n    results[0:9],\n    local_path='../../NOAAHackDay-Dec-2023/data',\n)\n\n Getting 9 granules, approx download size: 0.27 GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nearthaccess did a lot of heavy lifting for us. It identified the downloadable links, passed our Earthdata Login credentials, and save off the file with the proper name.

The IMERG Precipitation Rate provides the rain and snow rates in millimeters per hour (mm/hr). It is estimated by the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) algorithm. The IMERG algorithm uses passive-microwave data from the GPM constellation of satellites and infrared data from geosynchronous satellites. IMERG “morphs” observations to earlier or later times using wind from weather-model analyses. The daily IMERG dataset is derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day.\nLink to data on NASA Earthdata\nThe IMERG data has 0.1 x 0.1 degree latitude-longitude resolution (approximately 11 by 11 km at the Equator). The grid covers the globe, although precipitation cannot always be estimated near the Poles. The dataset and algorithm are described in the data user guide and the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\nPlease cite the dataset as: &gt; Huffman, G.J., E.F. Stocker, D.T. Bolvin, E.J.

What does subsetting mean? To subset means to extract only the portions of a dataset that are needed for a given purpose.\nThere are three primary types of subsetting that we will walk through: 1. Temporal 2. Spatial 3. Variable\nIn each case, we will be excluding parts of the dataset that are not wanted using xarray. Note that “subsetting” is also called a data “transformation”.\n\nds.time.values\n\narray(['2015-02-25T00:00:00.000000000', '2015-02-26T00:00:00.000000000'],\n      dtype='datetime64[ns]')\n\n\nWe start with a subset that represents the U.S. state of California. Notice the dimensions of the Dataset and each variable — time, lon, lat, and ‘nv’ (number of vertices) for the bounds variable.\n\n# Display the full dataset's metadata\nds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.Dataset&gt;\nDimensions:                         (time: 2, lon: 3600, lat: 1800, nv: 2)\nCoordinates:\n  * lon                             (lon) float32 -179.9 -179.9 ... 179.9 179.9\n  * lat                             (lat) float64 -89.95 -89.85 ... 89.85 89.95\n  * time                            (time) datetime64[ns] 2015-02-25 2015-02-26\nDimensions without coordinates: nv\nData variables:\n    precipitation                   (time, lon, lat) float32 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    precipitation_cnt               (time, lon, lat) int8 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    precipitation_cnt_cond          (time, lon, lat) int8 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    MWprecipitation                 (time, lon, lat) float32 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    MWprecipitation_cnt             (time, lon, lat) int8 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    MWprecipitation_cnt_cond        (time, lon, lat) int8 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    randomError                     (time, lon, lat) float32 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    randomError_cnt                 (time, lon, lat) int8 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    probabilityLiquidPrecipitation  (time, lon, lat) int8 dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\n    time_bnds                       (time, nv) datetime64[ns] dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 2), meta=np.ndarray&gt;\nAttributes: (9)xarray.DatasetDimensions:time: 2lon: 3600lat: 1800nv: 2Coordinates: (3)lon(lon)float32-179.9 -179.9 ... 179.9 179.9units :degrees_eastlong_name :Longitudearray([-179.95, -179.85, -179.75, ...,  179.75,  179.85,  179.95],\n      dtype=float32)lat(lat)float64-89.95 -89.85 ... 89.85 89.95units :degrees_northlong_name :Latitudearray([-89.95, -89.85, -89.75, ...,  89.75,  89.85,  89.95])time(time)datetime64[ns]2015-02-25 2015-02-26standard_name :timelong_name :timebounds :time_bndsarray(['2015-02-25T00:00:00.000000000', '2015-02-26T00:00:00.000000000'],\n      dtype='datetime64[ns]')Data variables: (10)precipitation(time, lon, lat)float32dask.array&lt;chunksize=(1, 3600, 1800), meta=np.ndarray&gt;units :mm/daylong_name :Daily mean precipitation rate (combined microwave-IR) estimate.

data chunks.\n\nds_subset['precipitation'].plot(figsize=(10,6), x='lon', y='lat');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s utilize the “Probability of liquid precipitation phase” (probabilityLiquidPrecipitation) variable to split apart the snow precipitation from everything else. From the variable’s description attribute, we can see that “0=missing values; 1=likely solid; 100=likely liquid or no precipitation”.\nMoreover, we’ll utilize precipitation_cnt_cond to filter out data points that had less than 0.01 mm/hr preciptation amounts.\n\nsnow = ds_subset['precipitation'].where(\n    (ds_subset.precipitation_cnt_cond&gt;0) & (ds_subset.probabilityLiquidPrecipitation == 1)\n)\n\nprcp = ds_subset['precipitation'].where(\n    (ds_subset.precipitation_cnt_cond&gt;0) & (ds_subset.probabilityLiquidPrecipitation != 1)\n)\n\nIn the following plotting commands, we utilize cartopy and matplotlib to generate a more customized figure.\ncartopy is used to set the map projection (to PlateCarree) and to add U.S. state boundary lines to the figure. matplotlib’s pcolormesh is used to generate the color plot, with colors determined by the third argument’s value.\n\n# create the plot\nproj = ccrs.PlateCarree()\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,5), dpi=130, facecolor=\"w\", subplot_kw=dict(projection=proj))\n\nsnowax = plt.pcolormesh(prcp.lon, prcp.lat, snow.squeeze(), vmax=53, cmap='cool')\nprcpax = plt.pcolormesh(prcp.lon, prcp.lat, prcp.squeeze(), vmax=53, cmap='RdYlGn')\n\nplt.colorbar(snowax, ax=ax, label=\"snow (mm/day)\")\nplt.colorbar(prcpax, ax=ax, label=\"rainfall (mm/day)\")\nax.add_feature(cfeature.STATES)\nax.set_extent([-125, -113.0, 31.0, 43.0], crs=proj)\nax.set_title(f'Precipitation {date_start}')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the enhancements?\nAlso, note that you can explore these (and other) data before generating your own customized plots, by using NASA Worldview. Here’s a link to an example map on Worldview for these IMERG data.\nEND of Notebook."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGoals\n\nIllustrate a common workflow for echosounder data conversion, calibration and use. This workflow leverages the standardization applied by echopype. and the power, ease of use and familiarity of libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem.\nDemonstrate the ease to interoperate echosounder data with those from a different instrument in a single computing environment. Without echopype, additional wrangling across more than one software systems is needed to achieve the same visualization and comparison.\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis notebook uses EK60 echosounder data from the U.S. Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) to illustrate a common workflow for data conversion, combination, calibration and analysis using echopype, as well as the data interoperability it enables. Without echopype, additional wrangling across more than one software systems is needed to achieve the same visualization and comparison.\nWe will use data from the OOI Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring collected on August 20-21, 2017. This was the day before and of a solar eclipse, during which the reduced sunlight affected the regular diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns of marine life. This change was directly observed using the upward-looking echosounder mounted on this mooring platform that happened to be within the totality zone. The effect of the solar eclipse was clearly seen by aligning and comparing the echosounder observations with solar radiation data collected by the Bulk Meteorology Instrument Package located on the nearby Coastal Endurance Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring, also maintained by the OOI.\nThe data used are 19 .raw files with a total volume of approximately 1 GB. With echopype functionality, the raw data files hosted on the OOI Raw Data Archive (an HTTP server) are directly parsed and organized into a standardized representation following in the SONAR-netCDF4 v1.0 convention, and stored to the cloud-optimized Zarr format. The individual converted files are later combined into a single entity that can be easily explored and manipulated.\n\n\nOutline\n\nEstablish connection with the OOI Raw Data Archive and generate list of target EK60 .raw files\nProcess the archived raw files with echopype: convert and combine into a single quantity (an EchoData object) in a standardized format.\nObtain solar radiation data from an OOI Thredds server.\nPlot the echosounder and solar radiation data together to visualize the zooplankton response to a solar eclipse.\n\n\n\nRunning the notebook\nThis notebook can be run with a conda environment created using the conda environment file https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples/blob/main/binder/environment.yml. The notebook creates a directory ./exports/notebook3 and save all generated Zarr and netCDF files there.\n\n\nWarning\nThe compute_MVBS step in this notebook is not efficient for lazy-loaded data with echopype version 0.6.3. We plan to address this issue soon.\n\n\nNote\nWe encourage importing echopype as ep for consistency.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport itertools as it\nimport datetime as dt\nfrom dateutil import parser as dtparser\n\nimport fsspec\nimport xarray as xr\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport hvplot.xarray\nimport panel\n\nimport echopype as ep\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)"

Note that the data filenames contain the time information but were recorded at UTC time.\n\ndef in_range(raw_file: str, start: dt.datetime, end: dt.datetime) -&gt; bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if file url is in datetime range\"\"\"\n    file_name = Path(raw_file).name\n    file_datetime = dtparser.parse(file_name, fuzzy=True)\n    return file_datetime &gt;= start and file_datetime &lt;= end\n\n\nstart_datetime = dt.datetime(2017, 8, 21, 7, 0)\nend_datetime = dt.datetime(2017, 8, 22, 7, 0)\n\nOn the OOI Raw Data Archive, the monthly folder is further split to daily folders, so we can simply grab data from the desired days.\n\ndesired_day_urls = [f\"{ooi_raw_url}/{day}\" for day in range(start_datetime.day, end_datetime.day + 1)]\n\n\ndesired_day_urls\n\n['https://rawdata.oceanobservatories.org/files/CE04OSPS/PC01B/ZPLSCB102_10.33.10.143/2017/08/21',\n 'https://rawdata.oceanobservatories.org/files/CE04OSPS/PC01B/ZPLSCB102_10.33.10.143/2017/08/22']\n\n\nGrab all raw files within daily folders by using the filesytem glob, just like the Linux glob.\n\nall_raw_file_urls = it.chain.from_iterable([fs.glob(f\"{day_url}/*.raw\") for day_url in desired_day_urls])\n\n\ndesired_raw_file_urls = list(filter(\n    lambda raw_file: in_range(\n        raw_file, \n        start_datetime-dt.timedelta(hours=3),  # 3 hour buffer to select files\n        end_datetime+dt.timedelta(hours=3)\n    ), \n    all_raw_file_urls\n))\n\n\nprint(f\"There are {len(desired_raw_file_urls)} raw files within the specified datetime range.\")\n\nThere are 19 raw files within the specified datetime range."

    "text": "Process the archived raw files with echopype\n\nExamine the workflow by processing just one file\nLet’s first test the echopype workflow by converting and processing 1 file from the above list.\nWe will use ep.open_raw to directly read in a raw data file from the OOI HTTP server.\nThe type of sonar needs to be specified as an input argument. The echosounders on the OOI Regional Cabled Array are Simrad EK60 echosounder. All other uncabled echosounders are the Acoustic Zooplankton and Fisher Profiler (AZFP) manufacturered by ASL Environmental Sciences. Echopype supports both of these and other instruments (see echopype documentation for detail).\n\n\nConverting from raw data files to a standardized data format\nBelow we already know the path to the 1 file on the http server:\n\nechodata = ep.open_raw(raw_file=desired_raw_file_urls[0], sonar_model=\"ek60\")\n\nHere echopype read, parse, and convert content of the raw file into memory, and gives you a nice representation of the converted file below as a Python EchoData object.\n\nechodata\n\n\n    \n        EchoData: standardized raw data from Internal Memory\n    \n    \n        \n

The Echodata object can be passed into various calibrate and preprocessing functions without having to write out any intermediate files.\nHere we demonstrate calibration to obtain \\(S_V\\).

A separate data variable in ds_Sv contains the physical range (echo_range) from the transducer in meters. echo_range has the same dimension as Sv and may not be uniform across all frequency channels or pings, depending on the echosounder setting during data collection.\n\n\nConvert multiple files and combine into a single EchoData object\nNow that we verified that echopype does work for a single file, let’s proceed to process all sonar data from August 20-21, 2017.\nFirst, convert all desired files from the OOI HTTP server to a local directory.\n\n# Create a directory for all converted files\noutput_dpath = Path(base_dpath / 'convertallfiles')\noutput_dpath.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n\n%%time\nfor raw_file_url in desired_raw_file_urls:\n    # Read and convert, resulting in echodata object\n    ed = ep.open_raw(raw_file=raw_file_url, sonar_model='ek60', use_swap=True)\n    ed.to_zarr(save_path=output_dpath, overwrite=True)\n\nThen, assemble a list of EchoData object from the converted files. Note that by using chunks={}, the files are lazy-loaded and only metadata are read into memory, until more operations are executed.\n\ned_list = []\nfor converted_file in sorted(output_dpath.glob(\"*.zarr\")):\n#     ed_list.append(ep.open_converted(converted_file))\n    ed_list.append(ep.open_converted(converted_file, chunks={}))\n\nCombine all the opened files to a single EchoData object.\n\ned_combined = ep.combine_echodata(ed_list)\n\nBelow we can inspect this combined EchoData object just as before.\nExpand the Provenance group to see how the filenames of all 19 files combined are stored in the coordinate variable echodata_filename, and many more data variables are added to retain information that was previously stored as attributes in the Provenance group of individual EchoData objects.\nExpand the Sonar/Beam_group1 to see how data variables such as backscatter_r and angle_alongship contain chunked dask arrays (that are lazy-loadded), instead of regular numpy arrays (that are fully loaded into memory). This means that the computation needed to combine the EchoData objects are specified but not yet executed, which is why the previous line ran through so fast. This is also the mechanism that allows dask to perform its magic for out-of-core computation.\n\ned_combined\n\n\n    \n        EchoData: standardized raw data from Internal Memory\n    \n    \n

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGoals\n\nIllustrate a common workflow for echosounder data conversion, calibration and use. This workflow leverages the standardization applied by echopype and the power, ease of use and familiarity of libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem.\nExtract and visualize data with relative ease using geospatial and temporal filters.\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis notebook uses EK60 echosounder data collected during the 2017 Joint U.S.-Canada Integrated Ecosystem and Pacific Hake Acoustic Trawl Survey (‘Pacific Hake Survey’) to illustrate a common workflow for data conversion, calibration and analysis using echopype and core scientific Python software packages, particularly xarray, GeoPandas, pandas and NumPy.\nTwo days of cloud-hosted .raw data files are accessed by echopype directly from an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 “bucket” maintained by the NOAA NCEI Water-Column Sonar Data Archive. The total data used are 170 .raw files at approximately 25 MB each (1 Hz pinging rate from first light to dusk), corresponding to approximately 4.2 GB. With echopype, each file is converted to a standardized representation based on the SONAR-netCDF4 v1.0 convention and saved to the cloud-optimized Zarr format.\nData stored in the netCDF-based SONAR-netCDF4 convention can be conveniently and intuitively manipulated with xarray in combination with related scientific Python packages. Mean Volume Backscattering Strength (MVBS) is computed with echopype from each raw data file and exported to a netCDF file. Here, we define two geographical bounding boxes encompassing two ship tracks and use these to extract corresponding timestamp intervals from the GPS data, and then the corresponding MVBS data based on those intervals. Finally, these extracted MVBS subsets are plotted as track echograms.\n\n\nOutline\n\nEstablish AWS S3 file system connection and generate list of target EK60 .raw files\nProcess S3-hosted raw files with echopype: convert, calibrate and export to standardized files\nExtract and process GPS locations from the Platform group of converted raw files\nRead MVBS and plot track echograms for time periods corresponding to two ship tracks\n\n\n\nRunning the notebook\nThis notebook can be run with a conda environment created using the conda environment file https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples/blob/main/binder/environment.yml. The notebook creates two directories, if not already present: ./exports/hakesurvey_convertedzarr and ./exports/hakesurvey_calibratednc. netCDF and Zarr files will be exported there.\n\n\nNote\nWe encourage importing echopype as ep for consistency.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nimport fsspec\nimport numpy as np\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport xarray as xr\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport cartopy.io.img_tiles as cimgt\nfrom cartopy.mpl.gridliner import LONGITUDE_FORMATTER, LATITUDE_FORMATTER\n\nimport echopype as ep\nfrom echopype.qc import exist_reversed_time\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)"

For each raw file: - Access file directly from S3 via ep.open_raw to create a converted EchoData object in memory - Add global and platform attributes to EchoData object - Export to a local Zarr dataset (a collection of files encapsulated in a directory) - Generate calibrated Sv and then MVBS from the raw data in the EchoData object - Export MVBS to a local netcdf file\nNote: Depending on your internet speed, this cell may take some time to run (potentially 20-30 mins).\n\n%%time\n\nfor s3rawfpath in s3rawfiles:\n    raw_fpath = Path(s3rawfpath)\n    try:\n        # Access file directly from S3 to create a converted EchoData object in memory\n        ed = ep.open_raw(\n            f's3://{s3rawfpath}',\n            sonar_model='EK60',\n            storage_options={'anon': True}\n        )\n        # Manually populate additional metadata about the dataset and the platform\n        populate_metadata(ed, raw_fpath.name)\n\n        # Save to converted Zarr format\n        ed.to_zarr(save_path=converted_dpath, overwrite=True)\n\n        # Use the EchoData object \"ed\" to generate calibrated and\n        # computed MVBS files that will be saved to netcdf\n        ds_Sv = ep.calibrate.compute_Sv(ed)\n        ds_MVBS = ep.commongrid.compute_MVBS(\n            ds_Sv,\n            range_bin='5m',  # in meters\n            ping_time_bin='20s',  # in seconds\n            \n        )\n        ds_MVBS.to_netcdf(calibrated_dpath / f'MVBS_{raw_fpath.stem}.nc')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'Failed to process raw file {raw_fpath.name}: {e}')\n\n/Users/wujung/miniconda3/envs/echopype_examples_v084/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xarray/core/duck_array_ops.py:215: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  return data.astype(dtype, **kwargs)\n/Users/wujung/miniconda3/envs/echopype_examples_v084/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xarray/core/duck_array_ops.py:215: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  return data.astype(dtype, **kwargs)\n/Users/wujung/miniconda3/envs/echopype_examples_v084/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xarray/core/duck_array_ops.py:215: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  return data.astype(dtype, **kwargs)\n\n\nCPU times: user 3min 18s, sys: 53.2 s, total: 4min 11s\nWall time: 9min\n\n\n\n\nTest for time reversals\nSmall time reversals are found in EK60 datasets, including the 2017 Pacific Hake survey, where the ping_time (or GPS time1) value may be lower (older) than the preceding ping_time by a second. Such discontinuities can interfere with concatenating individual raw files to produce an aggregated dataset. The capability to identify and address these reversals is in the echopype.qc subpackage.\n\nfor datapath in converted_dpath.glob('*'):\n    ed = ep.open_converted(datapath)\n    # Test for a negative ping_time increment in sequential timestamps, in the Sonar/Beam_group1 group\n    if exist_reversed_time(ds=ed['Sonar/Beam_group1'], time_name='ping_time'):\n        print(f'Reversed time in {datapath}')\n\nThere are no time reversals in this two-day dataset, fortunately.\n\n\nExamine the EchoData object for one of the data files\nechopype provides a user-friendly, convenient representation of an EchoData object that leverages the user-friendly xarray Dataset HTML representation. Since an EchoData object is effectively a container for multiple xarray.Dataset objects corresponding to netCDF4 groups, the notebook “print out” provides a summary view of all the groups and interactive access to summaries of each group.\nHere, ed is the last object opened in the time reversal test, in the preceding cell.\n\ned\n\n\n    \n        EchoData: standardized raw data from /Users/wujung/code_git/echopype-examples/notebooks/exports/notebook2/hakesurvey_convertedzarr/Summer2017-D20170728-T151434.zarr\n    \n    \n        \n            Top-level: contains metadata about the SONAR-netCDF4 file format.\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.Dataset&gt;

generated from the Platform group with the two rectangular regions, tracksouth_bbox and tracknorth_bbox. Extract from those clipped GeoDataFrames (tracksouth_gps_gdf and tracknorth_gps_gdf) the minimum and maximum time1 timestamps for each track and use them to select the corresponding time span in the MVBS data.\nFinally, create a MVBS Dataset subset for each track (tracksouth_MVBS_ds and tracknorth_MVBS_ds) by taking advantage of xarray’s “label”-based selection capability via the sel method. We select MVBS_ds data with ping_time values within the timestamp interval “slice” extracted from the geographical track. As we can see above, ping_time is a coordinate variable in the MVBS_ds Dataset.\n\ntracksouth_gps_gdf = gpd.clip(gps_gdf, tracksouth_bbox)\ntracksouth_MVBS_ds = MVBS_ds.sel(\n    ping_time=slice(tracksouth_gps_gdf.index.min(), tracksouth_gps_gdf.index.max())\n)\n\ntracknorth_gps_gdf = gpd.clip(gps_gdf, tracknorth_bbox)\ntracknorth_MVBS_ds = MVBS_ds.sel(\n    ping_time=slice(tracknorth_gps_gdf.index.min(), tracknorth_gps_gdf.index.max())\n)\n\n\n\nPlot MVBS echograms for the two N-S tracks, for all 3 frequencies\nThe final step is to create echogram plots (range vs ping_time) for each echosounder frequency and each of the two selected ship tracks. That’s 6 subplots. We first define two functions to simplify the task. plot_echograms plots the echograms of the 3 frequencies as a column of subplots, extracting the data for each frequency by using xarray’s isel index selector method, which uses index counts rather than values. As we can see above, frequency_nominal is a coordinate of the Sv (MVBS) DataArray.\n\ndef track_interval_str(trackdt):\n    \"\"\" Create the timestamp interval title string for a plot column\n    \"\"\"\n    track_interval_title_str = (\n        f\"{trackdt.index.min().strftime('%b-%d %H:%MZ')}\"\n        f\" to {trackdt.index.max().strftime('%b-%d %H:%MZ')}\"\n    )\n    return track_interval_title_str\n\ndef plot_echograms(ds, freq_len, column_idx):\n    \"\"\"Plot echograms of the 3 frequencies for xarray dataset ds,\n       as a column of subplots\"\"\"\n    for f in range(freq_len):\n        ax = axes[f][column_idx]\n        # Select Sv data by frequency using the frequency_nominal coordinate index \"f\",\n        # then plot the echogram of the selected data\n        ds.Sv.isel(frequency_nominal=f).plot(\n            ax=ax, \n            x='ping_time',\n            y='echo_range',\n            yincrease=False,\n            vmin=-80,\n            vmax=-50,\n        )\n        if f &lt; 2:\n            ax.set_xlabel(None);\n\n\nfreq_len = len(MVBS_ds.frequency_nominal)\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=freq_len, ncols=2, constrained_layout=True, figsize=(16, 16))\n\nfig.suptitle(\n    (f\"    South Track, {track_interval_str(tracksouth_gps_gdf)}\"\n     \"                                         \"\n     f\"North Track, {track_interval_str(tracknorth_gps_gdf)}\"),\n    fontsize=16)\n\nplot_echograms(tracksouth_MVBS_ds, freq_len, column_idx=0) # left column\nplot_echograms(tracknorth_MVBS_ds, freq_len, column_idx=1) # right column"

It is optimized for array-oriented data access and support a machine-independent format for representing scientific data.

Setup ***\nWe begin by importing all of the packages used in this notebook. If you have created an environment following the guidance provided with this tutorial, then the imports will be successful.\n\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport earthaccess\nimport h5netcdf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\n\nSet (and persist to your user profile on the host, if needed) your Earthdata Login credentials.\n\nauth = earthaccess.login(persist=True)\n\nBack to top  ## 2. Inspecting OCI L1B File Structure ***\nLet’s use xarray to open up a OCI L1B NetCDF file using earthaccess. We will use the same search method used in OCI Data Access. Note that L1B files do not include cloud coverage metadata, so we cannot use that filter.\n\ntspan = (\"2024-04-01\", \"2024-04-16\")\nbbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L1B_SCI\",\n    temporal=tspan,\n    bounding_box=bbox,\n)\n\n\npaths = earthaccess.open(results)\n\nWe want to confirm we are running code on a remote host with direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. The next cell has no effect if we are, and otherwise raises an error. If there’s an error, consider the substitution explained in the OCI Data Access notebook.\n\ntry:\n    paths[0].f.bucket\nexcept AttributeError:\n    raise \"The result opened without an S3FileSystem.\"\n\nLet’s open the first file of the L1B files list:\n\ndataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0])\ndataset\n\nNotice that this xarray.Dataset has nothing but “Attributes”. We cannot use xarray to open multi-group hierarchies or list groups within a NetCDF file, but it can open a specific group if you know its path. The xarray-datatree package is going to be merged into xarray in the not too distant future, which will allow xarray to open the entire hieerarchy. In the meantime, we can use a lower level reader to see the top-level groups.\nTODO: Link to a PACE/OCI user’s guide, referencing the section which explains each group.\n\nwith h5netcdf.File(paths[0]) as file:\n    groups = list(file)\ngroups\n\nLet’s open the “observation_data” group, which contains the core science variables.\n\ndataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0], group=\"observation_data\")\ndataset\n\nNow you can view the Dimensions, Coordinates, and Variables of this group. To show/hide attributes, press the paper icon on the right hand side of each variable. To show/hide data reprensetaton, press the cylinder icon. For instance, you could check the attributes on “rhot_blue” to see that this variable is the “Top of Atmosphere Blue Band Reflectance”.\nThe dimensions of the “rhot_blue” variable are (“blue_bands”, “number_of_scans”, “ccd_pixels”), and it has shape (119, 1709, 1272). The sizes attribute of a variable gives us that information as a dictionary.\n\ndataset[\"rhot_blue\"].sizes\n\nLet’s plot the reflectance at postion 100 in the “blue_bands” dimension.\n\nplot = dataset[\"rhot_blue\"].sel({\"blue_bands\": 100}).plot()\n\nBack to top  ## 3. Inspecting OCI L2 File Structure\nOCI L2 files include retrievals of geophysical variables, such as Apparent Optical Properties (AOP), for each L1 swath. We’ll use the same earthaccess search for L2 AOP data. Although now we can use cloud_cover too.\n\ntspan = (\"2024-04-01\", \"2024-04-23\")\nbbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)\nclouds = (0, 50)\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L2_AOP_NRT\",\n    temporal=tspan,\n    bounding_box=bbox,\n    cloud_cover=clouds,\n)\n\n\npaths = earthaccess.open(results)\ntry:\n    paths[0].f.bucket\nexcept AttributeError:\n    raise \"The result opened without an S3FileSystem.\"\n\n\nwith h5netcdf.File(paths[0]) as file:\n    groups = list(file)\ngroups\n\nLet’s look at the “geophysical_data” group, which is a new group generated by the level 2 processing.\n\ndataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0], group=\"geophysical_data\")\nrrs = dataset[\"Rrs\"]\nrrs\n\n\nrrs.sizes\n\nThe Rrs variable has length 184 in the wavelength dimension, so the blue, red, and SWIR wavelengths have been combined. Let’s map the Rrs at “wavelength_3d” position 100.\n\nplot = rrs.sel({\"wavelength_3d\": 100}).plot(cmap=\"viridis\")\n\nRight now, the scene is being plotted using number_of_lines and pixels_per_line as “x” and “y”, respectively. We need to add latitude and longitude values to create a true map. To do this, we will create a merged xarray.Dataset that pulls in information from the “navigation_data” group.\n\ndataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0], group=\"navigation_data\")\ndataset = dataset.set_coords((\"longitude\", \"latitude\"))\ndataset = dataset.rename({\"pixel_control_points\": \"pixels_per_line\"})\ndataset = xr.merge((rrs, dataset.coords))\ndataset\n\nAlthough we now have coordinates, they won’t immediately help because the data are not gridded by latitude and longitude. The Level 2 data cover the original instrument swath and have not been resampled to a regular grid. Therefore latitude and longitude are known, but cannot be used immediately to “look-up” values like you can along an array’s dimensions.\nLet’s make a scatter plot of the pixel locations so we can see the irregular spacing. By selecting a slice with a step size larger than one, we get a subset of the locations for better visualization.\n\nplot = dataset.sel(\n    {\n        \"number_of_lines\": slice(None, None, 1720 // 20),\n        \"pixels_per_line\": slice(None, None, 1272 // 20),\n    },\n).plot.scatter(x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\")\n\nLet’s plot this new xarray.Dataset the same way as before, but add latitude and longitude.\n\nrrs = dataset[\"Rrs\"].sel({\"wavelength_3d\": 100})\nplot = rrs.plot(x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", cmap=\"viridis\", vmin=0)\n\nNow you can project the data onto a grid. If you wanna get fancy, add a coastline.\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())\nax.coastlines()\nax.gridlines(draw_labels={\"left\": \"y\", \"bottom\": \"x\"})\nplot = rrs.plot(x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", cmap=\"viridis\", vmin=0, ax=ax)\n\nLet’s plot the full “Rrs” spectrum for individual pixels. A visualization with all the pixels wouldn’t be useful, but limiting to a bounding box gives a simple way to subset pixels. Note that, since we still don’t have gridded data (i.e. our latitude and longitude coordinates are two-dimensional), we can’t slice on a built-in index. Without getting into anything complex, we can just box it out.\n\nrrs_box = dataset[\"Rrs\"].where(\n    (\n        (dataset[\"latitude\"] &gt; 37.52)\n        & (dataset[\"latitude\"] &lt; 37.55)\n        & (dataset[\"longitude\"] &gt; -75.46)\n        & (dataset[\"longitude\"] &lt; -75.43)\n    ),\n    drop=True,\n)\nrrs_box.sizes\n\nThe line plotting method will only draw a line plot for 1D data, which we can get by stacking our two spatial dimensions and choosing to show the new “pixel dimension” as different colors.\n\nrrs_stack = rrs_box.stack(\n    {\"pixel\": [\"number_of_lines\", \"pixels_per_line\"]}, create_index=False,\n)\nplot = rrs_stack.plot.line(hue=\"pixel\")\n\nWe will go over how to plot Rrs spectra with accurate wavelength values on the x-axis in an upcoming notebook.\nBack to top  ## 4. Inspecting OCI L3 File Structure\nAt Level-3 there are binned (B) and mapped (M) products available for OCI. The L3M remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) files contain global maps of Rrs. We’ll use the same earthaccess method to find the data.\n\ntspan = (\"2024-04-16\", \"2024-04-20\")\nbbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L3M_RRS_NRT\",\n    temporal=tspan,\n    bounding_box=bbox,\n)\n\n\npaths = earthaccess.open(results)\ntry:\n    paths[0].f.bucket\nexcept AttributeError:\n    raise \"The result opened without an S3FileSystem.\"\n\nOCI L3 data do not have any groups, so we can open the dataset without the group argument. Let’s take a look at the first file.\n\ndataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0])\ndataset\n\nNotice that OCI L3M data has lat and lon coordinates, so it’s easy to slice out a bounding box and map the “Rrs_442” variable.\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())\nax.coastlines()\nax.gridlines(draw_labels={\"left\": \"y\", \"bottom\": \"x\"})\n\nrrs_442 = dataset[\"Rrs_442\"].sel({\"lat\": slice(-25, -45), \"lon\": slice(10, 30)})\nplot = rrs_442.plot(cmap=\"viridis\", vmin=0, ax=ax)\n\nAlso becuase the L3M variables have lat and lon coordinates, it’s possible to stack multiple granules along a new dimension that corresponds to time. Instead of xr.open_dataset, we use xr.open_mfdataset to create a single xarray.Dataset (the “mf” in open_mfdataset stands for multiple files) from an array of paths.\nWe also use a new search filter available in earthaccess.search_data: the granule_name argument accepts strings with the “*” wildcard. We need this to distinguish daily (“DAY”) from eight-day (“8D”) composites, as well as to get the 0.1 degree resolution projections.\n\ntspan = (\"2024-04-12\", \"2024-04-24\")\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L3M_CHL_NRT\",\n    temporal=tspan,\n    granule_name=\"*.DAY.*.0p1deg.*\",\n)\n\n\npaths = earthaccess.open(results)\ntry:\n    paths[0].f.bucket\nexcept AttributeError:\n    raise \"The result opened without an S3FileSystem.\"\n\nThe paths list is sorted temporally by default, which means the shape of the paths array specifies the way we need to tile the files together into larger arrays. We specify combine=\"nested\" to combine the files according to the shape of the array of files (or file-like objects), even though paths is not a “nested” list in this case. The concat_dim=\"date\" argument generates a new dimension in the combined dataset, because “date” is not an existing dimension in the individual files.\n\ndataset = xr.open_mfdataset(\n    paths,\n    combine=\"nested\",\n    concat_dim=\"date\",\n)\ndataset\n\nA common reason to generate a single dataset from multiple, daily images is to create a composite. Compare the map from a single day …\n\nchla = np.log10(dataset[\"chlor_a\"])\nchla.attrs.update(\n    {\n        \"units\": f'lg({dataset[\"chlor_a\"].attrs[\"units\"]})',\n    }\n)\nplot = chla.sel({\"date\": 0}).plot(aspect=2, size=4, cmap=\"GnBu_r\")\n\n… to a map of average values, skipping “NaN” values that result from clouds.\n\nchla_avg = chla.mean(\"date\")\nchla_avg.attrs.update(\n    {\n        \"long_name\": chla.attrs[\"long_name\"],\n        \"units\": f'lg({chla.attrs[\"units\"]})',\n    }\n)\nplot = chla_avg.plot(aspect=2, size=4, cmap=\"GnBu_r\")\n\n\n\nYou have completed the notebook on OCI file structure. More notebooks are comming soon!"

    "text": "Step 3:\nConfigure git with your name and email address.\n``` bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\n```\n\n**Note:** This name and email could be different from your github.com credentials. Remember `git` is a program that keeps track of your changes locally (on 2i2c JupyterHub or your own computer) and github.com is a platform to host your repositories. However, since your changes are tracked by `git`, the email/name used in git configuration will show up next to your contributions on github.com when you `push` your repository to github.com (`git push` is discussed in a later step).\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\nCopy link for the demo repository from your github account. Click the green “Code” button and copy the link as shown.\n\nClone the repository using git clone command in the terminal\nTo clone a repository from github, copy the link for the repository (previous step) and use git clone:\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/check_github_setup\nNote: Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME here with your github.com username. For example, it is virdi for my github.com account as seen in this image.\n\nUse ls (list files) to verify the existence of the repository that you just cloned\n\nChange directory to the cloned repository using cd check_github_setup and check the current directory using pwd command (present working directory)\n\nCheck status of your git repository to confirm git set up using git status\n\nYou are all set with using git on your 2i2c JupyterHub! But the collaborative power of git through github needs some additional setup.\nIn the next step, we will create a new file in this repository, track changes to this file, and link it with your github.com account.\n\n\nStep 4. Creating new file and tracking changes\n\nIn the left panel on your 2i2c JupyterHub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “check_github_setup” directory.\n\n\nOnce you are in the check_github_setup directory, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File).\n\nName the file lastname.txt. For example, virdi.txt for me (use your last name). Add some content to this file (for example, I added this to my virdi.txt file: my last name is virdi).\n\nNow you should have a new file (lastname.txt) in the git repository directory check_github_setup\nCheck if git can see that you have added a new file using git status. Git reports that you have a new file that is not tracked by git yet, and suggests adding that file to the git tracking system.\n\nAs seen in this image, git suggests adding that file so it can be tracked for changes. You can add file to git for tracking changes using git add. Then, you can commit changes to this file’s content using git commit as shown in the image.\ngit add virdi.txt\ngit status\ngit commit -m \"adding a new file\"\ngit status\n\nAs seen in the image above, git is suggesting to push the change that you just committed to the remote server at github.com (so that your collaborators can also see what changes you made).\nNote: DO NOT execute push yet. Before we push to github.com, let’s configure git further and store our github.com credentials to avoid entering the credentials every time we invoke git push. For doing so, we need to create a token on github.com to be used in place of your github.com password.\n\n\n\nStep 5. Create access token on github.com\n\nGo to your github account and create a new “personal access token”: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new\n\n\n\nGenerate Personal Access Token on github.com\n\n\nEnter a description in “Note” field as seen above, select “repo” checkbox, and scroll to the bottom and click the green button “Generate Token”. Once generated, copy the token (or save it in a text file for reference).\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nTo push (transfer) your changes to github, use git push in terminal. It requires you to enter your github credentials. You will be prompted to enter your github username and “password”. When prompted for your “password”, DO NOT use your github password, use the github token that was copied in the previous step.\ngit push\n\nNote: When you paste your token in the terminal window, windows users will press Ctrl+V and mac os users will press Cmd+V. If it does not work, try generating another token and use the copy icon next to the token to copy the token. Then, paste using your computer’s keyboard shortcut for paste.\nNow your password is stored in ~/.git-credentials and you will not be prompted again unless the Github token expires. You can check the presence of this git-credentials file using Terminal. Here the ~ character represents your home directory (/home/jovyan/).\nls -la ~\nThe output looks like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 22 17:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 root   root   4096 Oct  4 16:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan 1754 Oct 29 18:30 .bash_history\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 29 16:38 .config\n-rw-------  1 jovyan jovyan   66 Oct 22 17:35 .git-credentials\n-rw-r--r--  1 jovyan jovyan   84 Oct 22 17:14 .gitconfig\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 jovyan jovyan 6144 Oct 21 16:19 2021-Cloud-Hackathon\nYou can also verify your git configuration\n(notebook) jovyan@jupyter-virdi:~$ git config -l\nThe output should have credential.helper = store:\nuser.email        = Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\nuser.name         = Makhan Virdi\ncredential.helper = store\n\nNow we are all set to collaborate with github on the JupyterHub during the Cloud Hackathon!\n\n\nSummary: Git Commands\n\nCommonly used git commands (modified from source)\n\n\nGit Command\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngit status\nShows the current state of the repository: the current working branch, files in the staging area, etc.\n\n\ngit add\nAdds a new, previously untracked file to version control and marks already tracked files to be committed with the next commit\n\n\ngit commit\nSaves the current state of the repository and creates an entry in the log\n\n\ngit log\nShows the history for the repository\n\n\ngit diff\nShows content differences between commits, branches, individual files and more\n\n\ngit clone\nCopies a repository to your local environment, including all the history\n\n\ngit pull\nGets the latest changes of a previously cloned repository\n\n\ngit push\nPushes your local changes to the remote repository, sharing them with others\n\n\n\n\n\nGit: More Details\nLesson: For a more detailed self-paced lesson on git, visit Git Lesson from Software Carpentry\nCheatsheet: Frequently used git commands\nDangit, Git!?!: If you are stuck after a git mishap, there are ready-made solutions to common problems at Dangit, Git!?!\n\n\nCloning our repository using the git JupyterLab extension.\nIf we’re already familiar with git commands and feel more confortable using a GUI our Jupyterhub deployment comes with a git extension.

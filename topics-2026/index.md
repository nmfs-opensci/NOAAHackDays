During these stand-alone informal sessions we will get introduced to a variety of tools for ocean data access and analysis in Python and R. 
We will be using the NOAA Fisheries Openscapes JupyterHub and you will not need to install anything.  [About the HackHours](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAAHackDays/content/hackhours.html)

## How to clone the git repository 

Never cloned the NOAAHackDays repo?

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAAHackDays
```

Have cloned it but need to update? This is going to destroy any changes that you made to the repo to make it match the current state of the repo on GitHub.

```  
cd ~/NOAAHackDays
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```
